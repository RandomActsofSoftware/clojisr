#ClojisR example: Titanic #0

This notebook is a variation of Pradeep Tripathi's Titanic [Kaggle solution](https://www.kaggle.com/pradeeptripathi/prediction-of-titanic-survival-using-r/code) in R. Instead of writing it in R as the original, we write it in Clojure, and call R from Clojure.

The goal is to study the Clojure-R interop, and expecially experiment with various ways to define Clojure functions corresponding to R functions.

In this first, naive version, the corresponding Clojure functions are rather simple. They expect a varying number of arguments, and pass those arguments to R function calls by a rather generic way (as defined by Clojisrs)

We do not try to replace the rather imperative style of the original tutorial. Rather, we try to write something that is as close as possible to the original.

We have leanred a lot from this use case. It did expose lots of issues and open questions about the Clojisr API and implementation. Note, however, that the piece of R code that we are mimicing here is not so typical to the current tidyverse trends -- there is no heavy use of dplyr, tidy evaluation, etc. It may be a good idea to study other examples that have more of those.

This notebook has been written in [notespace](https://github.com/scicloj/notespace) -- an experimental Clojure library that allows one to use regular Clojure namespaces as notebooks, thus enabling interactive literate programming from ones' favourite Clojure editor and REPL.
